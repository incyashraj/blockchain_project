# Blockchain Project

This project is an independent blockchain infrastructure designed to run locally, enabling fundamental blockchain operations such as mining, validation, and chain inspection. 
Built with Python, Flask, and Postman for API testing, this setup lays the foundation for creating a custom cryptocurrency and integrating with tools like MetaMask and Remit for smart contracts.

## Features
- **Blockchain Operations**: Mine new blocks, validate the chain, and fetch chain details.
- **Proof of Work**: Implements a simple Proof of Work algorithm.
- **HTTP API**: Uses Flask to expose endpoints for blockchain interactions.
- **Extendable Architecture**: Can be extended to include cryptocurrency and smart contract functionality.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need the following:
- Python 3.10 or later
- Flask (for the HTTP API)

Install the required packages using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
